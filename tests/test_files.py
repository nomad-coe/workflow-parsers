    Creates an upload_files object and the underlying files for test/mock purposes.

    Arguments:
        upload_id: The upload id for the upload. Will generate a random UUID if None.
        archives: A list of class:`datamodel.EntryArchive` metainfo objects. This will
            be used to determine the mainfiles. Will create respective directories and
            copy the template entry to create raw files for each archive.
            Will also be used to fill the archives in the create upload.
        published: Creates a :class:`PublicUploadFiles` object with published files
            instead of a :class:`StagingUploadFiles` object with staging files. Default
            is published.
        embargo_length: The embargo length
        raw_files: A directory path. All files here will be copied into the raw files
            dir of the created upload files.
        template_files: A zip file with example files in it. One directory will be used
            as a template. It will be copied for each given archive.
        template_mainfile: Path of the template mainfile within the given template_files.
        additional_files_path: Path to additional files to add.
